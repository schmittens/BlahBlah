using functions in lists:

def func1():return 1
def func2():return 2

list = [func1, func2]

or

list = ['string',func1]

or

list = [
	
	('google', recognizer_google),
	('ibm', recognizer_ibm)

	]

for item in list:
	print(item[0])
	item[1](audio)    <=== Does this work?


Alternative: exec(object [globals, locals]) ?

if object is string, it is parsed as a suite python statements and then executed
if object is a code object, it is executed
